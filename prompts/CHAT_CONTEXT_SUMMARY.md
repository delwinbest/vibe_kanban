- Database indexes for performance
- Real-time subscriptions configured
- Sample data populated

#### Phase 3: Basic UI Components ✅
- App component structure with modal provider
- Board component with consolidated header
- Column component with modern styling
- Card component with priority badges (P1, P2, P3) and status indicators
- Modal system with provider and context
- Loading states and error boundaries

#### Phase 4: Redux Store Setup ✅
- Complete Redux Toolkit store with all slices
- Board slice with real-time subscriptions
- Column slice with CRUD operations
- Card slice with filtering and real-time updates
- Label slice with complete CRUD operations
- UI slice for drag-and-drop state
- Comprehensive selectors for derived state
- Optimistic updates implementation

#### Phase 5: Drag & Drop Implementation ✅
- DndContext provider setup with @dnd-kit/core
- Column drag and drop with database persistence
- Card drag and drop between columns
- Card reordering within columns
- Keyboard navigation (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+Arrow, Enter/Space)
- Touch support for mobile devices (250ms latency, 44px touch targets)
- Drag performance optimizations (React.memo, useMemo, hardware acceleration)
- Visual feedback during drag operations

#### Phase 6: Card Management ✅
- Complete card CRUD operations with modals
- Card creation modal with validation
- Card detail modal for editing
- Card deletion with confirmation
- In-place editing for title, description, due date, priority
- Real-time search functionality
- Optimistic updates for smooth UX

#### Phase 7: Column Management ✅
- Complete column CRUD operations
- Column creation modal with validation
- Column editing with in-place updates
- Column deletion with card cleanup options
- Column reordering with database persistence
- Real-time updates and optimistic UI feedback

### 🚧 Current Bug Report
**Real-time Sync Issue**: Card deletions from one app instance don't automatically update other running instances. Users need to refresh the page to see changes. Root cause suspected in subscription handling for DELETE events.

### 📋 Next Phase: Phase 8 - Labels and Tags System
- Label management system with color customization
- Label assignment to cards
- Label-based filtering and grouping
- Label statistics and analytics

### Git Branch Strategy
- **main**: Production branch - stable, tested code
- **development**: Integration branch - ongoing development (current)
- **feature/***: Feature branches (e.g., feature/phase-5-keyboard-navigation)

- Responsive mobile-first design

## Development Workflow

### GitHub Operations Rules (Enforced)
All bug reports MUST follow this workflow:
1. **Create GitHub Issue FIRST** (before any code changes)
2. Create fix branch from development
3. Implement fix with proper tests
4. Commit with "Fixes #X" message
5. Create PR from fix branch to development
6. Link PR to issue

### Pre-commit Checklist (Mandatory)
- TypeScript compilation (`npm run type-check`)
- ESLint (`npm run lint`)
- Build verification (`npm run build`)

### Branch Management
- Feature branches: `feature/phase-X-description`
- Bug fix branches: `fix/issue-description`
- Never commit directly to main
- Always merge through development first
