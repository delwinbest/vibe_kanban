# User Prompts - Vibe Kanban Project

## Initial Project Request

**Date**: October 2025

I need to write a software specification (PRD), and I need your help with writing it. The output should be formatted as Markdown and should not use emojis.

I want to build a Trello-style kanban board using Vite and dnd-kit with drag & drop functionality and beautiful design. 

Here are some features I think I will need:

- Multiple columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) that can hold task cards
- Smooth drag and drop functionality between columns
- Ability to add new cards to any column
- Ability to edit in place a card name
- Ability to add new columns
- Ability to rename columns
- Ability to delete columns
- Storage using Supabase

Ask follow-up questions if something is unclear BEFORE you start generating.

## Clarification Questions Response

1. React with Vite
2. Tailwind CSS
3. React Redux
4. Please include all the properties you listed.
5. Single user application.
6. yes
7. Data export/import
8. The user should be prompted with a warning explaining that the action will also delete all card. If the user agrees, delete the associated cards. 
9. Delete individual cards
10. single board for now.
IT should be a responsive layout that supports both desktop and mobile browser viewports.

## File Creation Requests

### SPECIFICATION.md Creation
store this PRD in a file called SPECIFICATION.md using markdown to improve readibility

### TODO.md Creation
based on this specification, create a todo list and store in a file called TODO.md

### PROMPTS.md Creation
