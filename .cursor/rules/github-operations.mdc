# GitHub Operations and Development Workflow

## Git Branching Strategy

### General Git Branching Management
- Always ensure local respoitories are up to date before making changes to local branches. 
- Before making any changes to code, ensur you follow the branching strategy outlined in this document. Start by making sure you are using the correct branch. 

### Branch Structure
- **`main`**: Production branch - only for stable, tested code
- **`development`**: Integration branch - ongoing development work
- **`feature/*`**: Feature branches for specific functionality
- **`fix/*`**: Bug fix branches for issues and problems

### Branch Naming Conventions
- Feature branches: `feature/phase-X-description` (e.g., `feature/phase-5-drag-drop`)
- Bug fix branches: `fix/issue-description` (e.g., `fix/page-reload-on-card-operations`)
- Use kebab-case for branch names
- Include issue numbers when applicable

## Development Workflow

### Starting New Work
1. **Create feature branch from `development`**:
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   git checkout -b feature/phase-X-description
   ```

2. **Update TODO.md** to reflect current work and mark tasks as in-progress
3. **Implement changes** with frequent commits
4. **Test thoroughly** before creating pull request

### Commit Practices
- **Use conventional commit messages**:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `refactor:` for code improvements
  - `docs:` for documentation updates
  - `style:` for formatting changes
  - `test:` for test additions
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

- **Include detailed commit messages**:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "fix: Prevent full page reload on card add/remove operations

  - Implement optimistic updates for card operations (create, update, delete)
  - Remove loading states during card operations to prevent LoadingSpinner re-render
  - Add deduplication logic to prevent real-time subscription conflicts
  - Remove setTimeout delays from modal closing
  - Add React.memo to Card, Column, and Board components for performance
  - Only show loading spinner on initial data fetch, not during card operations

  Fixes #7 - Full page reload on card add/remove instead of reactive updates"
  ```

### Pull Request Process
1. **Create pull request** from feature branch to `development`
2. **Link to GitHub issues** using `Fixes #X` or `Closes #X`
3. **Include comprehensive PR description**:
   - Summary of changes
   - Related issues
   - Testing instructions
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Code quality notes
   - Acceptance criteria checklist

4. **Wait for review and approval**
5. **Merge to `development`** after approval
6. **Create PR from `development` to `main`** for production deployment

## GitHub Issue Management

### General Issue and Bug Management (MANDATORY WORKFLOW)
**CRITICAL: This workflow MUST be followed for ALL bug reports and fixes.**

#### Bug Identification and Classification
- **When user reports a bug**: STOP all current work immediately
- **Determine if it's a bug**: 
  - Bug = Existing functionality that worked before but now fails
  - NOT a bug = New feature requests, test failures, build failures, or code improvements
- **If it's a bug**: Follow the mandatory bug workflow below
- **If it's not a bug**: Treat as feature request or improvement

#### Mandatory Bug Workflow (MUST FOLLOW)
1. **Create GitHub Issue FIRST** (before any code changes):
   - Use the bug template below
   - Include root cause analysis
   - Add steps to reproduce
   - Define acceptance criteria
   - Add appropriate labels (`bug`, `priority-high/medium/low`)

2. **Create Fix Branch** (from development):
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   git checkout -b fix/issue-description
   ```

3. **Implement Fix**:
   - Make code changes
   - Test thoroughly
   - Follow pre-commit checklist

4. **Commit with Issue Reference**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "fix: Brief description of fix

   Fixes #X - Detailed description of the bug"
   ```

5. **Create PR**:
   - From fix branch to development
   - Link to GitHub issue
   - Include testing instructions

6. **Associate Everything**:
   - Link PR to issue
   - Use "Fixes #X" in commit message
   - Update issue with PR reference

#### Enforcement Rules
- **NEVER fix bugs directly on feature branches**
- **NEVER commit bug fixes without creating an issue first**
- **NEVER skip the GitHub issue creation step**
- **ALWAYS use fix/* branch naming for bug fixes**
- **ALWAYS link commits and PRs to the GitHub issue**

### Issue Creation
- **Use clear, descriptive titles**
- **Include problem statement** with current behavior
- **Add root cause analysis** when applicable
- **Provide steps to reproduce** for bugs
- **Define acceptance criteria** for features
- **Use appropriate labels**: `bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, `performance`, etc.

### Issue Templates
```markdown
## üêõ Problem Statement
[Clear description of the issue and current broken behavior]

## üîç Root Cause Analysis
[Technical analysis of the problem - what's causing the bug]

## üéØ Expected Behavior
[What should happen when the feature works correctly]

## üìã Steps to Reproduce
1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3
4. Observe the error/bug

## üß™ Testing Strategy
[How to test the fix - what to verify]

## üìã Acceptance Criteria

```

## Code Review Process

### Pre-Commit Checklist (MANDATORY)
**ALWAYS run these commands before committing code:**
```bash
# 1. Type checking (MUST PASS)
npm run type-check

# 2. Linting (MUST PASS)
npm run lint

# 3. Build verification (MUST PASS)
npm run build

# 4. Only commit if all checks pass
git add .
git commit -m "your commit message"
```

**Type checking failures are BLOCKING issues - do not commit until resolved.**

### Before Submitting PR
- [ ] **Run linting**: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **Type checking**: `npm run type-check` (MANDATORY - must pass before commit)
- [ ] **Test locally**: Verify functionality works
- [ ] **Update documentation**: README, TODO.md, CHAT_CONTEXT_SUMMARY.md
- [ ] **Check for breaking changes**
- [ ] **Ensure CI/CD passes**

### PR Review Checklist
- [ ] **Code quality**: Follows project conventions
- [ ] **Performance**: No unnecessary re-renders or API calls
- [ ] **Security**: No sensitive data exposure
- [ ] **Testing**: Adequate test coverage
- [ ] **Documentation**: Clear comments and documentation
- [ ] **Error handling**: Proper error boundaries and fallbacks

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- **CI Pipeline**: Runs on every PR
  - TypeScript compilation
  - ESLint checking
  - Build verification
- **Deployment Pipeline**: Runs on merge to `main`
  - Build production assets
  - Deploy to GitHub Pages
  - Only triggers on `main` branch pushes

### Environment Management
- **Development**: Local development with hot reload
- **Staging**: GitHub Pages deployment from `main`
- **Production**: Same as staging (static hosting)

## SSH and Authentication

### SSH Key Management
- **Use SSH keys** for GitHub authentication
- **Add keys to SSH agent**: `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`
- **Check loaded keys**: `ssh-add -l`
- **Fallback to HTTPS** if SSH fails

### Remote Configuration
- **Primary remote**: `git@github.com:username/repo.git`
- **HTTPS fallback**: `https://github.com/username/repo.git`
- **Switch remotes**: `git remote set-url origin <new-url>`

## Documentation Updates

### Required Documentation Updates

- **Use .env files** for local development
- **Use GitHub Secrets** for CI/CD
- **Validate environment variables** at startup

### Code Security
- **Sanitize user inputs** before processing
- **Use proper authentication** for API calls
- **Implement proper error handling** without exposing internals
- **Keep dependencies updated** for security patches

## Release Management

### Versioning
- **Use semantic versioning**: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
- **Update package.json** version numbers
- **Create git tags** for releases
- **Document breaking changes** in release notes

### Release Process
1. **Merge to main** from development
2. **Run full test suite**
3. **Update version numbers**
4. **Create release notes**
5. **Tag the release**

ssh-add -l

# Add key to agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ecdsa

# Test GitHub connection
ssh -T git@github.com

# Switch to HTTPS if needed
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git pull origin development

# Resolve conflicts manually
# Stage resolved files
git add .

# Complete merge
git commit -m "resolve: Merge conflicts in file.ts"
```

### CI/CD Failures
- **Check TypeScript errors**: `npm run type-check`
- **Fix linting issues**: `npm run lint`

## Bug Handling Enforcement

### CRITICAL: Bug Workflow Violations
**If you violate the bug workflow, you MUST:**
1. **Acknowledge the violation** immediately
2. **Stop current work** and follow proper workflow
3. **Create the missing GitHub issue** with full details
4. **Move the fix to a proper fix/* branch**
5. **Re-commit with proper "Fixes #X" message**
6. **Update all documentation** to reflect the proper process

### Quality Gates
- **No bug fixes on feature branches** - this is a blocking violation
- **No commits without GitHub issues** for bugs - this is a blocking violation
- **All bug fixes must be traceable** through GitHub issues
- **All PRs must link to issues** they address

### Accountability
- **Document all workflow violations** in commit messages
- **Explain why the proper process wasn't followed**
- **Commit to following the process in future**
- **Update team on process improvements**# GitHub Operations and Development Workflow
