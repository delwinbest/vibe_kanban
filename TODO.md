## Notes & Considerations

### Development Priorities
1. **Core Functionality First**: Focus on basic drag-and-drop and CRUD operations
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure mobile experience is excellent from the start
3. **Performance**: Optimize for smooth drag operations and fast loading
4. **Real-time Features**: Implement collaboration features early for testing
5. **Accessibility**: Build accessibility into components from the beginning

### Technical Debt Prevention
- Write tests alongside feature development
- Document components and functions as you build them
- Follow consistent coding patterns and conventions
- Regular code reviews and refactoring
- Performance monitoring from early stages

### Risk Mitigation
- Test drag-and-drop functionality extensively across devices
- Implement robust error handling for real-time features
- Plan for offline scenarios and data synchronization
- Consider browser compatibility early in development
- Monitor bundle size and performance metrics regularly

## 📋 Development Notes

### Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit/core with sortable utilities
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time + Auth)
- **Database**: Complete schema with RLS policies and indexes

### Git Branch Strategy
- **`main`**: Production-ready code, stable releases
- **`development`**: Integration branch for ongoing development (current branch)
- **`feature/*`**: Feature branches for new functionality

### Development Workflow
1. All development work happens on `development` branch
2. Create feature branches from `development` for new features
3. Merge feature branches back to `development` after review
4. Merge `development` to `main` for production releases
5. Keep `main` branch stable and production-ready
