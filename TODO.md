## Notes & Considerations

### Development Priorities
1. **Core Functionality First**: Focus on basic drag-and-drop and CRUD operations
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure mobile experience is excellent from the start
3. **Performance**: Optimize for smooth drag operations and fast loading
4. **Real-time Features**: Implement collaboration features early for testing
5. **Accessibility**: Build accessibility into components from the beginning

### Technical Debt Prevention
- Write tests alongside feature development
- Document components and functions as you build them
- Follow consistent coding patterns and conventions
- Regular code reviews and refactoring
- Performance monitoring from early stages

### Risk Mitigation
- Test drag-and-drop functionality extensively across devices
- Implement robust error handling for real-time features
- Plan for offline scenarios and data synchronization
- Consider browser compatibility early in development
- Monitor bundle size and performance metrics regularly
