## 📋 Development Notes

### Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **Drag & Drop**: @dnd-kit/core with sortable utilities
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Real-time + Auth)
- **Database**: Complete schema with RLS policies and indexes

### Git Branch Strategy
- **`main`**: Production-ready code, stable releases
- **`development`**: Integration branch for ongoing development (current branch)
- **`feature/*`**: Feature branches for new functionality

### Development Workflow
1. All development work happens on `development` branch
2. Create feature branches from `development` for new features
3. Merge feature branches back to `development` after review
4. Merge `development` to `main` for production releases
5. Keep `main` branch stable and production-ready
